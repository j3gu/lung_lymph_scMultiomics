reproducibility.

The results in this page were generated with repository version

See the <em>Past versions</em> tab to see a history of the changes made
to the R Markdown and HTML files.

<p>
Note that you need to be careful to ensure that all relevant files for
the analysis have been committed to Git prior to generating the results
(you can use <code>wflow_publish</code> or
<code>wflow_git_commit</code>). workflowr only checks the R Markdown
file, but you know if there are other scripts or data files that it
depends on. Below is the status of the Git repository when the results
were generated:

<h1>MAGMA</h1>
<p><strong>Gene analysis</strong> A linear principal component
regression model that estimates whether there is genetic effect of gene
g on the phenotype Y, conditional on all covariates. The model first
projects genotype matrix for a gene g onto its PCs, pruning away PCs
with very small eigenvalues. Then it performs F test in the regression
of Y on SNP matrix and covariates to estimate genetic effect.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
  Y = \alpha_{0g}\vec 1 + X_g^*\alpha_g  + W\beta_g + \epsilon_g
\]</span> When inividual geneotype matrix not available, MAGMA performs
gene test with mean <span class="math inline">\(X^2\)</span> statistics
and a gene p-value is then obtained by using a known approximation of
the sampling distribution. Please refer to the following paper for
details of approximation for the distribution of the weighted
combination of p-values. This model requires summary statistics and
reference LD panel.</p>
<p>Ref: Hou C (2005) A simple approximation for the distribution of the
weighted combination of non-independent or independent probabilities.
Stat Probabil Lett 73: 179–187.</p>
<p><strong>Competitive gene-set analysis</strong></p>
<p>One-sided Two-sample T test or linear regression in equivalence is
applied to test whether the genes in a gene set are more strongly
associated with Y or not.</p>
<p>Let Z denote the association z-score. Let <span
class="math inline">\(\S_s\)</span> be an indicator variable with
element <span class="math inline">\(s_g = 1\)</span> defined as for gene
g in gene set s and 0 otherwise. The goal is to test whether <span
class="math inline">\(\beta_s\)</span> is greater than zero, which
represents the difference in association between genes in the gene set
and genes outside the gene set.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
Z = \beta_{0s}\vec 1 + S_s\beta_s + \epsilon
\]</span> This also be tested by unpaired two sample T-test, while two
samples can have unequal variances and sample sizes.</p>

<p>When corrected for multiple testing, tests will be significant if
p-value lower than ~0.005. Around half of the tests show significant
p-values, which makes us wonder if p-values are inflated. Then we try
using the input genes for topic modeling rather than all genes as
background so that they are more comparable.</p>

<h3>Test enrichment using top 100 genes from each topic</h3>
<p>The supplementary table from MAGMA paper shows the mean type 1 error
rates are well controlled for a set of size 100. The <a
href="https://www.gsea-msigdb.org/gsea/msigdb/human/genesets.jsp?collection=CP">MSigDB
canonical pathways</a> contains 1320 gene sets from a number of
different databases. I can look into the average size of the gene sets.

alt="MAGMA controlling for type 1 error rates for gene-set analysis" /></p>
<p>Instead of all DE genes, I used top 100 up-regulated genes ranked by
z scores to test the enrichment for each topic. Now we see only k3, k4,
k5 and k12 (4/12) topics show significant enrichment after multiple
testing correction.</p>

<h2>Gene-set associations for known immune cell markers</h2>
<p>Most immune cell markers were obtained from Gene ontology. The
tissue-resident genes were from the single-cell lung paper and ChatGPT.
After multiple correction, tissue-resident markers do not show
significance for the gene-set association with Asthma. Neither do the
genes involved in cell-cell adhesion or cell migration. The gene sets
that are significantly enriched for higher association with Asthma risks
are activation of T/B cells and differentiation of T cell lineage
differentiation.</p>
