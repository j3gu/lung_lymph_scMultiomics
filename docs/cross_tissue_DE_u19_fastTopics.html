reproducibility.

The results in this page were generated with repository version
<a href="https://github.com/j3gu/lung_lymph_scMultiomics/tree/152c6ee5409609dd69f2f9790a064c229f4afcaf" target="_blank">152c6ee</a>.
See the <em>Past versions</em> tab to see a history of the changes made
to the R Markdown and HTML files.

<p>
Note that you need to be careful to ensure that all relevant files for
the analysis have been committed to Git prior to generating the results
(you can use <code>wflow_publish</code> or
<code>wflow_git_commit</code>). workflowr only checks the R Markdown
file, but you know if there are other scripts or data files that it
depends on. Below is the status of the Git repository when the results
were generated:

<p>Each of the three spleen samples are in separate batches. Topic 10-12

which is reassuring.</p>

(IL17A, IL22) are interleukins that signal immune cells to defend

<li>hypergeometric test (ORA from <a

</ul>
<p>A test purely depends on occurrences, asking whether the genes
related to a topic occur more frequently in GO term compared to the
background genes.</p>
<ul>
<li>two-sample T test or regression (<a

</ul>
<p>It tests whether the genes in a set is more associated with

<p><strong>Visualizing GO enrichment with ComplexHeatmap</strong></p>

</ul>
<p>BP results show k1 enriched for granulocyte activation and neutrophil
mediated immunity, as well as cell adhesion and motility. These pathways
are highly relevant to Asthma. Due to high number of GO terms
over-represented by k1 genes, we may repeat the topic modeling by
increasing topic number. Several topics like k2, 6, 7, 9, 10 are
strongly enriched with protein localization. Topics k3-6 have genes
over-represented in T-cell activation, while k10, 12 in B-cell
activation.</p>
<p>MF results show broad enrichment of molecular binding, with k7 highly
enriched for cell adhesion molecular binding.</p>
