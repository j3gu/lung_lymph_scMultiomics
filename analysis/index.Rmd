# Welcome to the project website. 

This project is about using functional profiling of lung immune cells to better understand the genetics of asthma and allergy diseases.

## Introduction
TBD

## Literature reviews 

## Results

### Heritability enrichment
[test heritability enrichment and identify the relevant cell type or tissue](u19_h2g_enrichment.html)


### Topic analysis
Topic models on scRNA-seq data 

- [identify topics with different proportions between tissue](cross_tissue_DE_u19_fastTopics.html)
- [test topic enrichment for genetic risks using MAGMA](gene_set_analysis_for_RNA_topics.html) 
- [test motif enrichment for topic-specific genes](U19_motif_analysis.html)  

Topic models on lung scATAC-seq data
- [identify topics with high proportion in cases](u19_lung_atac_fastTopics.html)

### GRN analysis
[test motif enrichment for TF targets from GRN](identify_TFs_with_immune_function.html)
